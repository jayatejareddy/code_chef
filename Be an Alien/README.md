**<p align=center>Be an Alien</p>**

Planet Kenda is inhabited by Aliens.
The vision of the Aliens is topsy turvy.
Given a rectangular chunk of text, whatever a human reads in the top-left corner will be seen in the bottom-right corner by the Aliens; whatever a human reads in the top-right corner will be seen in the bottom-left corner by the Aliens - and so on.

**A quick example:**</br>
If this is what a human being sees:</br>
ABC</br>
DEF</br>
GHI</br>

This is what a Alien will see:</br>
IHG</br>
FED</br>
CBA</br>

**A bigger example:**</br>
For humans beings, if a fragment of text is visible as :</br>
123</br>
223</br>
323</br>
423</br>
523</br>
623</br>

for Aliens, the same text is seen as :</br>
326</br>
325</br>
324</br>
323</br>
322</br>
321</br>

**Task**</br>
Your task is to take a read a set of characters and print the Aliens format of the same characters as output.

**Constraints**</br>
The testcases are similar to the second example in the problem statement. Test cases will have six lines, with exactly 3 numerals each.
